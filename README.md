# Abstract
Regression, in the domain of machine learning and data science, corresponds to the estimation of a continuous dependent variable or response from a set of input variables/features. Regression models are statistical models that use a line or, in the case of two or more independent variables, a plane, to represent the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The concept of regression and regression models can be used to model disease progression related aspects. In this research, a dataset composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring was used to predict the clinician's PD symptom score on the UPDRS scale. This was achieved via the use of regression modeling via Pycaret's regression library of functions, and python.
